# MicrosoftGroupChatClient
Simple client app for Microsoft GroupChat 2010

To compile and run you need to install the Microsoft Lync Server 2010 Group Chat SDK.  Download it from here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=23647

That needs a very specific version of the core runtime.  The easiest way to install that is to download the server install from here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=12480.  Run the installer so it installs the runtime core then cancel it before it installs the full server.
